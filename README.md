# Alcmene - **The QE Lead Challenge**

A bit of context: Alcmene is the mother of Heracles and Heracles is the name for our Software Engineer in Test challenge.

Congratulations on reaching this part of the process! This challenge will serve as a base for our discussion during the next interview.
For this role, even though programming is not a central part of it, we expect our engineering leads to have strong technical expertise and we are excited to discuss this further with you but first we need you to do a little bit of investigating ðŸ”Ž.

To set the stage for the next interview, we picked one of the challenges submitted by a previous candidate for the SET position and we would like you to analyze it. We already evaluated this challenge and made a decision based on its contents and our evaluation criteria. For the purpose of this exercice, we cannot comment further on our decision but we are eager to receive your analysis ! :D

You will find the README submitted by the candidate, followed by the instructions for our SET challenge in the [solution readme](./SOLUTION_README.md).

## Instructions
- Make the application run
- Read and investigate the code, evaluate it as if you were in our position
- Document your thought process for the analysis
- Document your analysis (a small presentation can be nice)

## Analysis guidelines
When evaluating code quality, here are some topics that can be interesting to elaborate on:

- Application architecture
- Quality of documentation
   - Is the documentation clear?
   - Is the documentation relevant?
   - Can you get the application running quickly?
   - Any other points you would like to add
- Quality of the code
   - Is the code easily readable?
   - Does the structure of the modules, classes, functions make sense?
   - Are best practices followed for the language that was used?
- Quality of the tests
   - We will let you impress us with this category :D !
- Any other points you think might be relevant

# What would be awesome
- You come up with suggestions that we did not see before
- You dazzle us with your incredible communication skills !
- You make links between the SET solution and some use cases you have seen in your career

The outcome of this analysis can be a simple document, a presentation (Google Slides, Prezi, etc.) or both. When you are ready to submit the challenge, send us the document and let us know so we can schedule a session for the presentation. Feel free to include as much details as you want but we also want to be mindful of your time, please let us know how long the analysis took you.

Happy reviewing ðŸš€ðŸ”Ž !
